# Tech Advocate Project

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum.

Instead of a recipes website, I am building a simple HTML website that showcases different aspects of being a Technology Advocate. The goal is to practice core web development and Git skills while presenting real-world tech advocacy roles.

## Project Sections
The website is divided into the following areas:
- Community Building
- Event Hosting
- Web3 Advocacy
- Technical Writing

Each section highlights what a Technology Advocate does, the skills involved, and how these roles contribute to growing tech ecosystems.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated:
- Writing semantic HTML
- Structuring a multi-page website
- Using links and navigation between pages
- Organizing files and folders properly
- Using Git and GitHub for version control
- Writing clear commit messages and committing regularly
